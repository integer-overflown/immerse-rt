# Immerse-rt

Home to immerse-rt project, the real-time spatial audio engine
reliant on HRTF algorithms and listener position awareness ðŸŽ§

The primary purpose of this project is bringing immersive feel to live streams,
but the list of its potential applications is surely not limited to a single use-case.

| libs/   | Crates that provide library interface and generic logic and calculations. The actual implementations are located in impls/ folder and are plugged-in based on the platform, build settings, etc. |

## Building the project

The primary concepts, calculations and logic are implemented in Rust.
However, different implementations require platform-specific code, which often leverages the corresponding
languages.

Such implementations are built with CMake, which is extensible and supports many platforms and languages.
